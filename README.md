# autoware-maps

Reverse for eNV200 and Twizy is not supported, so we aim to build maps with this in mind

Test lanelet2 osms with:
- [X] diff speeds -> works
- [ ] differnet parking widths -> doesn't seem to work if set to something different to 3
- [ ] across a lane -> doesn't seem to work
- [ ] changing road type -> 

when creating linestring, the parking space is to the left of the base
